  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate and goal-driven Data Science enthusiast currently pursuing an
    M.Tech in Data Science at PICT. I have a strong foundation in Machine Learning,
    Generative AI, and Data Structures, with hands-on experience in applying data
    science techniques to real-world problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am proficient in Python for data analysis and machine learning, with practical
    experience using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Keras. In
    addition, I have working knowledge of Java and C++ for algorithmic
    problem-solving and strengthening core data structure concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have successfully qualified GATE 2024 (DA) and GATE 2025 (DA), reflecting
    strong analytical ability and academic consistency. My internship experience
    has further strengthened my ability to design, build, and evaluate data-driven
    solutions for real-world applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am actively seeking internship and job opportunities where I can further
    enhance my expertise and contribute to impactful AI and data-driven projects.

    <h3>Object Detection using YOLOv3</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a real-time object detection system capable of identifying
      more than 75 object classes using YOLOv3 and OpenCV. The system processes
      live video streams and images to detect and localize objects with high
      accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Python, YOLOv3, OpenCV, Deep Learning
    </p>
    <p>
